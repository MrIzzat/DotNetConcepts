ClientSetNull
#
The ClientSetNull is used when you have entities that may or may not have a parent, and you want EF to take care of nulling out the foreign key for you.
It is the default option for entities that can exist without a parent usually make use of optional relationships.
SetNull
#
The SetNull option is used when you want the database to also try to propagate null values to child foreign keys even when the child entity is not loaded.
However, note that the database must support this, and configuring the database like this can result in other restrictions,
which in practice often makes this option impractical. This is why SetNull is not the default.
